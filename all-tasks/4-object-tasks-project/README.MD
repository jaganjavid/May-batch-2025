# 🦸 SuperHero Manager 9000

Welcome to the SuperHero Manager 9000!

Your job is to take this basic app (ES5 or ES6 version) and turn it into a **full-featured superhero management tool** using only **HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and JavaScript**.

---

## 🚀 Task Goals

You must improve the current app by adding the following features:

---

### ✅ 1. **Local Storage Integration**
- Save heroes to `localStorage` so that data persists after page reload.
- On page load, auto-fetch and render all saved heroes.

---

### ✅ 2. **Edit Hero Details and delete also**
- Add an “Edit” button beside each hero.
- When clicked, allow editing `name`, `powerLevel`, and `secretIdentity`
- After update, reflect changes in the list and `localStorage`.

---

### ✅ 3. **Search Filter**
- Add a search input at the top to filter heroes by name (real-time).

---

### ✅ 4. **Power Level Sort**
- Add two buttons: 🔼 Sort Ascending, 🔽 Sort Descending
- Clicking these should reorder the list of heroes by power level.

---

### ✅ 5. **Add Hero Category**
- Each hero can now belong to a category: `Flying`, `Speed`, `Tech`, `Mystic`
- Add a dropdown in the form to select category
- Show the category as a badge in the UI

---

### ✅ 6. **Dark Mode Toggle 🌙**
- Add a simple dark/light theme switcher (can use Bootstrap dark mode or custom class toggling)

---
